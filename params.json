{"name":"MFI Gamepad Feeder","tagline":"vJoy feeder for MFI Gamepads","body":"# MFI Gamepad Feeder\r\n\r\nHave youever wanted to use your MFI (Made for iPhone/iPad) game controller under Windows? With *MFI Gamepad Feeder* it's possible!\r\n\r\n## How it works?\r\n\r\n*MFI Gamepad Feeder* is a special program that needs to be used in tandem with [vJoy](http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net \"vJoy\") that creates virtual joystick/gamepad device in your system.\r\n\r\nAfter installing *vJoy* you will recieve dummy joystick device that won't do actually anything fancy. In order to control it, you'll have to use special kind of programs, called *feeders*, in our case *MFI Gamepad Feeder*.\r\n\r\nIt looks like modern MFI game controllers are recognized as standrad HID gamepads under Windows, but they're not visible in \"USB Game Controllers\", so games won't be able to use them. *MFI Gamepad Feeder* is connecing to these \"HID gamepads\", and it's redirecting raw input from them, directly to the vJoy devices.\r\n\r\nOn this page I will guide you how to install and configure *vJoy*, and how to pair it with *MFI Gamepad Feeder*  \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nCurrent version of *MFI Gamepad Feeder* requires\r\n\r\n* installed vJoy driver (v2.1.6)\r\n* supported MFI Gamepad (see list of supported gamepads is listed below)\r\n\r\nApplication was tested on WIndows 10, but it should work on older systems as well.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Download and install [vJoy 2.1.6 ](http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net \"vJoy\") \r\n2.

Launch *MFI Gamepad Feeder* application, click it's icon in the taskbar in order to maximize it, and select:\r\n\t1. Your gamepad from \"Gamepad device\" list. In my case (Steelseries Nimbus gamepad), gamepad wasn't advertising itself with correct Product name / Manufacturer Name, so I've had to guess which one it was\r\n\t2. ID of your vJoy (\"1\" in most cases)\r\n\t3. Correct configuration file (All configuration files are stored in the \"Configs\" folder in the application folder\r\n\t4.
